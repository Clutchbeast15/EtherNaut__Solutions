#  🚀 Ethernaut__Solutions by  BugBeast15

Welcome to **Ethernaut__Solutions** — a curated walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF challenges, solved locally using Foundry. This repository documents my hands-on journey to mastering smart contract auditing, especially within the DeFi ecosystem.



## 🔍 Purpose

To deeply understand how smart contract vulnerabilities arise, how they can be exploited, and how they should be mitigated — all through real challenges, structured learning, and an auditor’s mindset.



## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

Each folder in this repository focuses on **one Ethernaut challenge** and contains:

- 📚 **Explainer** — What is the vulnerability? Why does it exist?
- ⚔️ **Exploit** — A reproducible strategy and code to solve the level.
- 🛡️ **Prevention** — How to secure contracts against similar bugs.
- ✅ **Tests** — Foundry-based test cases proving the exploit and validating the fix.
